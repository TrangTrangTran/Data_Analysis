"I gotta say, there have been a TON of new recipes for this instant noodle. I don’t know how many brands are changing recipes out there, but it’s nice to know when they do. This is something they do in Malaysia, specifically Penang, Malaysia, an awful lot. The folks at MyKuali told me how you might go to a hawker stall one day and have something really great and a week later it’s almost unrecognizable in hopes of having the next super popular food item.

"Here we have the latest in the long line of Buldak varieties from Samyang Foods. This is Buldak Light – so let me explain. This one has only 375 calories. The noodles are not fried, so all that oil used in frying isn’t present. But not only is it lighter on calories, it’s lighter on heat. It’s 40% less spicy than original Buldak Bokkeummyun clocking in at 2,600SHU compared to the original’s 4,400SHU.I’ve been asked by a lot of people over the years if Samyang would release a less spicy version, and so I guess I can finally say yes – yes they will and have. I should note that this is not an export version and is specifically for the South Korean market, although I’m sure channels such as eBay will be stuffed with packs for sale with differing prices. What can make you rest slightly easy on that is that fried noodles are a little more fragile than their non-fried counterparts – so these should take a pretty hard beating in the mail and show up unscathed.Well, let’s give this a try!The noodle block.The spicy sauce.The dry mixture of seaweed and sesame.Watch me cook on Instant Noodle Recipe Time!Watch me burn on Spicy Noodle Mukbang!"
