After eating it, and if you still have some soup left in the cup, some people cook the rest of the soup in a pot with some cooked rice together and it becomes a nice porridge.”You know, I remember having seafood steampot and hot pot in Taiwan where at the end of the meal we enjoyed rice that my buddies wife stirred and stirred and made this kind of congee style last treat from.

       "96  Here’s what they had to say on this one – “This is the first Kanisuki ramen from Wa-raa series. Kanisuki is one of the nabe dishes, and is usually enjoyed as you cook crabs and vegetables (Chinese cabbages, garland chrysanthemum, and Shiitake mushrooms) in soy sauce and kelp based broth soup. The soup includes extract from Hokkaido snow crab, which sounds very rich in flavor. After eating it, and if you still have some soup left in the cup, some people cook the rest of the soup in a pot with some cooked rice together and it becomes a nice porridge.”You know, I remember having seafood steampot and hot pot in Taiwan where at the end of the meal we enjoyed rice that my buddies wife stirred and stirred and made this kind of congee style last treat from.
